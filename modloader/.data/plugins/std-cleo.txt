	Name: std-cleo --- (Standard CLEO Plugin)
	Version: Release Candidate 2
	Author: LINK/2012 <dma_2012@hotmail.com>
	Default Priority: 50
*************************************************************************

Description:
	This is the standard CLEO loader, it loads files related to the CLEO modification.
	So, it handles the following extensions: cs, cm, cleo and fxt.

Usage:
	Just copy the specific CLEO file with cs, cm, cleo or fxt extension to anywhere inside a mod folder.
	Or you can put the files inside a CLEO folder inside a mod folder.
	The second way is recommended and is normally what comes in packed mods.

Weakness and Limitations:
	[*] It goes against one of the ModLoader main rules, to not touch the main game install.
	    This plugin copies CLEO specific files into the CLEO\ folder at the main path.
	   	But yeah, it does a cleanup when the game closes. On abnormal game termination, the cleanup is done on game startup.
	   	
	   	For that reason, I'd recommend you to chooce between installing all your CLEO mods in one of the two ways:
	   	    Option 1:
	   	        Disable the std-cleo loader (see plugins.ini) and keep your CLEO files inside the main CLEO/ folder
	   	        
	   	    Option 2:
	   	        Put all, I mean all you CLEO mods and files (except .cleo plugins) in modloader bounds.
	   	        
        Choosing one of the options above will guarantee a better performance in the CLEO loading, but that's not a requisite.
